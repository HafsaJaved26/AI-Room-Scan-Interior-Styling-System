# AI Room Scan & Interior Styling System
## Module 3: Style Mode 3 - AI Auto-Design Implementation

**Author:** Abdul Jabbar (Member 7)

### Overview
This module handles the automatic generation of interior design prompts without requiring any user style input. The AI decides the design automatically based on the room's physical appearance and characteristics.

### Deliverables Achieved
* **Auto-design algorithm:** Programmatically processes JSON room data into a cohesive text prompt.
* **Prompt generation rules:** Formats object lists and appends quality enhancers for optimal image generation.
* **Room analysis to style mapping:** Maps room characteristics (brightness, size, type) to specific interior design styles and atmospheres.

### Inputs Required
This script requires the room analysis summary data generated by Member 4. 
The script expects a `summaries/` directory containing JSON files with the following extracted features:
* Brightness level (dark, medium, bright)
* Room size (small, medium, large)
* Objects present
* Room type determination (e.g., bedroom, living room)

### How It Works (Mapping Rules)
1. **Style Selection:** * Bright + Large spaces map to "Modern luxury".
   * Dark + Small spaces map to "Warm minimalist".
2. **Atmosphere Selection:**
   * Bedrooms map to a "Calm, restful, serene" atmosphere.
   * Living rooms map to a "Social, comfortable, inviting" atmosphere.

### Usage
1. Ensure the `summaries/` folder from Module 2 is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the Python script:
   `python auto_design.py`

### Outputs & Pipeline Handoff
The script will output a single master file named `auto_prompts.json`. 
This file is formatted as a dictionary mapping each frame name to its automatically generated text prompt. This file should be passed directly to Member 8 to be used as the text input for the Image Generation & Redesign module.
