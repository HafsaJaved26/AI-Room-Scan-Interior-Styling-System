# [cite_start]AI Room Scan & Interior Styling System [cite: 1]
## [cite_start]Module 3: Style Mode 3 - AI Auto-Design Implementation [cite: 127, 147]

[cite_start]**Author:** Abdul Jabbar (Member 7) [cite: 147]

### Overview
[cite_start]This module handles the automatic generation of interior design prompts without requiring any user style input[cite: 149, 151]. [cite_start]The AI decides the design automatically based on the room's physical appearance and characteristics[cite: 152].

### [cite_start]Deliverables Achieved [cite: 161]
* [cite_start]**Auto-design algorithm:** Programmatically processes JSON room data into a cohesive text prompt[cite: 170].
* [cite_start]**Prompt generation rules:** Formats object lists and appends quality enhancers for optimal image generation[cite: 171].
* [cite_start]**Room analysis to style mapping:** Maps room characteristics (brightness, size, type) to specific interior design styles and atmospheres[cite: 172].

### Inputs Required
[cite_start]This script requires the room analysis summary data generated by **Member 4 (Ghazal Hafeez)**[cite: 87, 154, 155]. 
The script expects a `summaries/` directory containing JSON files with the following extracted features:
* [cite_start]Brightness level (dark, medium, bright) [cite: 156]
* [cite_start]Room size (small, medium, large) [cite: 157]
* [cite_start]Objects present [cite: 158]
* [cite_start]Room type determination (e.g., bedroom, living room) [cite: 104, 158]

### How It Works (Mapping Rules)
1. [cite_start]**Style Selection:** * Bright + Large spaces map to "Modern luxury"[cite: 163].
   * [cite_start]Dark + Small spaces map to "Warm minimalist"[cite: 164].
2. **Atmosphere Selection:**
   * [cite_start]Bedrooms map to a "Calm, restful, serene" atmosphere[cite: 165].
   * [cite_start]Living rooms map to a "Social, comfortable, inviting" atmosphere[cite: 166].

### Usage
1. Ensure the `summaries/` folder from Module 2 is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the Python script:
   `python auto_design.py`

### Outputs & Pipeline Handoff
The script will output a single master file named `auto_prompts.json`. 
This file is formatted as a dictionary mapping each frame name to its automatically generated text prompt. [cite_start]This file should be passed directly to **Member 8 (Afia Noor)** to be used as the text input for the Image Generation & Redesign module[cite: 174, 185].
